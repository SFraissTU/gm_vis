Gaussian Mixture Model visualization toolkit

This toolkit was written as part of the diploma thesis [Construction and Visualization of Gaussian Mixture Models from Point Clouds for 3D Object Representation](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2022/FRAISS-2022-CGMM/FRAISS-2022-CGMM-thesis.pdf).
Its main features are an ellipsoid visualization and a density visualization of 3D Gaussian Mixtures. These visualization are provided in both a standalone graphical user interface and a Python interface.

Current dependencies are Anaconda, Qt5 and Pybind11 (see CMakeLists.txt).

There also exists an experimental isosurface-visualization, which is not fully implemented and not guaranteed to create correct results.
